## Introduction
This is a course project of group **EZ4.0** for CSCC01 at UTSC in the 2021 Summer.

The goal of this platform will be to provide the end to end experience for our target users (aspiring, first time
African entrepreneurs) - where they can come in with their problem/need identified, learn how to build
their solution, get involved in bigger communities and build their companies.

## Motivation
As mentioned by the African Impact Initiative:
> From our 2020 pilot in Ghana, weâ€™ve identified the need for a more user-focused and user-friendly
platform that integrates the various jobs to be done which the challenge provides to those aspiring entrepreneurs who we
support.

We realized that it is a great chance for us to utilize our enhanced technical skills, and this project indeed meets our desires of helping people in developing areas.

As such, we decided to build a virtual platform that mainly focuses on the community and E-Learning features for our potential users, since efficient learning experiences and effective communications play a crucial role for first-time entrepreneurs, registered companies and partners.

That is how "FANCYNAME" comes into our minds.
