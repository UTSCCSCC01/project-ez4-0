## Introduction
This is a course project of group **EZ4.0** for CSCC01 at UTSC in 2021 Summer.

The goal of this platform will be to provide the end to end experience for our target users (aspiring, first time
African entrepreneurs)- where they can come in with their problem/need identified, learn how to build
their solution, get involved into bigger communities and build their companies.

## Motivation
As mentioned by the African Impact Initiative:
> From our 2020 pilot in Ghana, weâ€™ve identified the need for a more user-focused and user-friendly
platform that integrates the various jobs to be done which the challenge provides to those aspiring entrepreneurs who we
support.
