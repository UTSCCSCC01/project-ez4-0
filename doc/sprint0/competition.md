### Why are we different?
The goal of our project is to provide a platform for both entrepreneurs, companies and partners and allow them to build a community where they can share, learn, and gather resources. The key difference between our platform and the similar platforms is we are focusing on young entrepreneurs who wants to be success and have all tools required to help them. We provide them all the resources they might need, they can communicate and share their ideas and thoughts using our posting feature, learning how to be successful from the videos we provided and looking for resources or services from our partners. Our competitors might be able to provide part of the services but none of them can atually provide a all-in-one commuity like us.
