# Done

This section is what our team agrees as what ”done” means for the features of our project.


The bullet points below is the definition of done our team agrees.
-   the code is well-written and documented. Which implies, the team does not have to rewrite it.
-   the code is checked in on the repository.
-   the code passed all automated tests at each appropriate levels.
-   the feature the code implements has been documented.

Moreover, for each user story we will come up with a set of "conditions of satisfaction".
For example, the user story in our product backlog, 

" As a user, I want to sign in to my account so that I can enjoy the services on the platform", might include the following conditions of satisfaction:
-   user is logged in only when user name and password are macthed
-   there is a "remember" option
-   user can request to reset the password


For a user story to be done, both the definition of done should be satisfied and the conditions of satisfaction should be fulfilled as well.
