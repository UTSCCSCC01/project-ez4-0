# Done

This section is what our team agrees as what ”done” means for the features of our project.


The bullet points below is the definition of done our team agrees.
-   the code is well-written and documented. That is, the team does not have to rewrite it.
-   the code is checked in on the repository.
-   the code passed all automated tests at each appropriate levels.
-   the code has been either pair programmed or has been code inspected.
-   the feature the code implements has been documented as needed in any end-user documentation.

Moreover, for each user story we will come up with a set of "conditions of satisfaction".
For example, the first user story in our product backlog, 

" As a user, I want to sign in to my account so that I can enjoy the services on the platform", might include these conditions of satisfaction:
-   user is logged in only when proper credentials are provided
-   a "remember me" option is available
-   user can request a password reminder


For a user story to be done, both the definition of done should be satisfied and the conditions of satisfaction should be fulfilled as well.
