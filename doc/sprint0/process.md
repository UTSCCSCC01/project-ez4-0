# Process

This section is for our team reflect on how we have worked together and decide what we should do to improve the working efficiency of our team.

First of all, roles is divided clearly in our team. 
- scrum master: JunXing Xu
- developers:JunXing Xu, Zhenye Zhu,  Houde Liu, Jiale Yu, Xianghu Dai
- testers: Zhenye Zhu,  Houde Liu, Jiale Yu, Xianghu Dai

These roles might change as the project is developing.



As for decision making, for those crucial decisions which are decisive for our project, we will first brain storm and come up with some possible ideas. We will  then carefully discuss those ideas and try to reach an agreement. However, whenever there is a conflict, we have decided to simply use voting to decide if we should make the decision or which decision should be made.

Prioritizing user stories is vital for our project. 
The priorities of a user story are evaluated based on the following criteria:

-   Value: what value does the story add to application
-   Cost: the cost of adding the desire feature. Some features may prove too costly to implement.
-   Risk: there always exists uncertainty about value/cost
-   Knowledge: if the product owner doesn’t have enough information and knowledge to implement the feature.

In this way, we put all our user stories into 4 categories and prioritize them as one of the following:

 - **M**ust Have: the first beta of the project absolutely requires this feature.
-   **S**hould Have: it would be nice if this feature is implemented in the project, but it isn’t absolutely required. They may be as important, but not as time-critical, as Must-Haves.
-   **C**ould Have: the user story has value and is desirable, but ultimately is not necessary.
-   **W**on’t Have: the user story is understood to be amongst the least-critical or lowest value.

Moreover, as for the meetings, our team has decided to hold stand up meeting everyday using the discord channel. This might change as the project is proceeding.

Since while our team are discussing about the product backlog, we found that some of the features might involve knowledge and algorithms related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. So for the next phase, our team members are all looking forward to learn the required knowledge and perfect our project.
