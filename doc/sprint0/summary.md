# Summary

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a community and e-learning platform for the African entrepreneurs so that they can implement and deliver their innovative ideas and access virtual content to help them success. It also allows registered companies and partners to do job postings and interact with the entrepreneurs easily.

### Key users
The key users of this project are:
- African entrepreneurs that want to share their thoughts, deliver their products, learn different skills and have close relationship with companies.
- Companies that want to promote themselves and have contact with entrepreneurs.
- Partners (investors, service providers, corporations) that want to interact with entrepreneurs and companies or provide them with services.

### Scenarios
Some of the scenarios are:
- Alice ([an African entrepreneur](./personas.pdf)) logged in to the platform, made a post to talk about her startup idea and received replies from other entrepreneurs that are interested in the topic. She then sent a private message to one of the replier that had the similar idea with her for further discussion.
- Alice ([an African entrepreneur](./personas.pdf)) logged in to the platform and navigated to the resources page. Then she selected one of the video series about startup skills training from a list of serieses recommended by the platform. She is able to keep track of her progress by viewing the progress bar on top of the page.
- Bob ([a company manager]((./personas.pdf))) logged in to the platform and navigate to his company profile page. He clicked on the 'Post a Job' button and started to fill out details about the position. After he finished, he clicked on the 'Post' button and the system prompted him that the job was successfully posted. He then being redirected back to his company profile page and saw the job that he just posted along with all the previous posts sorted by time by default.

### Principles
The principles are:
- Different designs for different types of users. Entrepreneurs should see a list of posts from others and can naivgate to the resources page to access video content. Companies should have an easy way to do job posting. Partners should see a list of resources that entrepreneurs or companies are looking for.
- User roles should be distinctive and can be easily identified. This can be done by adding tags on the profiles.
